Project Description: An  Intelligent  Connect-Four  Player  using  the  Minimax  Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Heuristic Functions.

Build an artificial Connect-Four player that can play games against a human opponent. 
Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union;
is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 
Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The goal of this group project is to design and implement an intelligent Connect-Four player, leveraging AI techniques such as the Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Heuristic Functions. 
Connect Four is a popular two-player game where the objective is to connect four of one's own-colored discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before the opponent does.

Minimax Algorithm: Minimax is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games with perfect information, like Connect Four. 
It evaluates possible moves by simulating the entire game tree and selects the move that minimizes the maximum possible loss. 
The Minimax Algorithm can be implemented to create an intelligent Connect Four player capable of making optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or achieving a draw.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique applied to the Minimax Algorithm. 
It reduces the number of nodes explored in the game tree by eliminating branches that are guaranteed not to impact the final decision. 
Integrating Alpha-Beta Pruning enhances the efficiency of the Connect-Four player, making it more responsive and capable of handling larger search spaces.

Heuristic Functions: Heuristic functions provide a shortcut for evaluating game states without exhaustively exploring all possible moves. 
In Connect Four, heuristic functions can assess the current board state based on factors like the number of connected discs and potential winning configurations. 
By incorporating heuristic functions, the AI player can make informed decisions without exhaustively searching the entire game tree.
